# 	Turing Suggests Test for Success

**Paper** : Turing, A. M. ["Computing Machinery and Intelligence."](http://phil415.pbworks.com/f/TuringComputing.pdf) Mind 49 (1950): 433-460.

## The Turing Paper

- What question is Turing attempting to answer in his paper? How does he
transform the question? Why?
  
- What is Turing's answer to his question? What is his prediction regarding the
creation of intelligent machines? Was his prediction accurate? Why or why not?
- What presumptions does Turing make with respect to the importance of our
learning, visual, linguistic, and motor capabilities? Do his presumptions reflect his
mathematical background?
- Turing provides various arguments against arguments against the possibility of
machine intelligence. Which is the strongest? Which is the weakest?
